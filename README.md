CAKL: Commutative Algebra K-mer Learning

CAKL is an alignment-free method that computes k-mer algebraic representations of sequences based on k-mer analysis leveraging tools from commutative algebra, as detailed in the main manuscript. Though the code is designed for DNA sequences, the method can be generalized to arbitary finite sequences.

## Description

CAKL is an alignment-free method that computes k-mer algebraic representations of sequences based on k-mer analysis leveraging tools from commutative algebra, as detailed in the main manuscript. Though the code is designed for DNA sequences, the method can be generalized to arbitary finite sequences.

## Basic Usage

- **`example.py`**  
  Provides a minimal example for generating features.  
  Simply replace the placeholder sequence with your own sequence and run the script.  
  You can also modify it as needed to suit your workflow.  

- **`example.ipynb`**  
  A complete example pipeline:  
  - Reads sequences from a FASTA file and their labels from a CSV file.  
  - Generates features for each sequence (saved as individual NumPy arrays).  
  - Stacks the features into a single feature matrix.  
  - Computes the distance matrix from the generated features.
  - Construct the tree, view it, and save a Newick version of the tree.
